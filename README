YouTube API.

This API allows you to pull all of today's top YouTube videos and display them in a webpage.

The API runs on JavaScript which can be inserted into the page and then the results will be displayed in a <div> which in this case is called #mybox.

You can call the div anything you like (just remember to change the API code to point to your div.

Index.html file has also been uploaded so that you can see the whole script implemented in a page.


The API can be modified so that you can pull videos from different parts of YouTube and from different locations. Go to the YouTube API site to learn how.


Happy watching.
